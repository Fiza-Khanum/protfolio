# protfolio
This is my personal portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills, projects, and achievements in a simple and responsive design. The purpose of this portfolio is to highlight my work and provide an easy way for others, including recruiters and collaborators, to view my projects and learn more about me.
